## SI 206 W17 - Project 2 

## COMMENT HERE WITH:
## Your name: Zachary Blitz
## Anyone you worked with on this project:

## Below we have provided import statements, comments to separate out the parts of the project, instructions/hints/examples, and at the end, tests. See the PDF of instructions for more detail. 
## You can check out the SAMPLE206project2_caching.json for an example of what your cache file might look like.

###########

## Import statements
import unittest
import json
import requests
import tweepy
import twitter_info # Requires you to have a twitter_info file in this directory
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import re

## Tweepy authentication setup
## Fill these in in the twitter_info.py file
consumer_key = twitter_info.consumer_key
consumer_secret = twitter_info.consumer_secret
access_token = twitter_info.access_token
access_token_secret = twitter_info.access_token_secret
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)

# Set up to be able grab stuff from twitter with your authentication using Tweepy methods, and return it in a JSON format 
api = tweepy.API(auth, parser=tweepy.parsers.JSONParser())

## Part 0 -- CACHING SETUP

## Write the code to begin your caching pattern setup here.

twitter_cache_data = '206project2_caching.json'

try:

	twitter_cache_file = open(twitter_cache_data, 'r')
	twitter_cache_contents = twitter_cache_file.read()
	CACHE_DICTION = json.loads(twitter_cache_contents)
	twitter_cache_file.close()

except:
	CACHE_DICTION = {}


## PART 1 - Define a function find_urls.
## INPUT: any string
## RETURN VALUE: a list of strings that represents all of the URLs in the input string



## For example: 
## find_urls("http://www.google.com is a great site") should return ["http://www.google.com"]
## find_urls("I love looking at websites like http://etsy.com and http://instagram.com and stuff") should return ["http://etsy.com","http://instagram.com"]
## find_urls("the internet is awesome #worldwideweb") should return [], empty list

def find_urls(x):
	list_of_strings = re.findall("https?://[^\s]*?\...[^\s]*", x)
	return(list_of_strings)





## PART 2 (a) - Define a function called get_umsi_data.
## INPUT: N/A. No input.
## The function should check if there is any cached data for the UMSI directory in your cached file -- if so, return it, and if not, the function should access each page of the directory, get the HTML associated with it, append that HTML string to a list. The function should cache (save) that list when it is accumulated.
## RETURN VALUE: A list of HTML strings representing each page of the UMSI directory. 
## Reminder: you'll need to use the special header for a request to the UMSI site, like so:
#### requests.get(base_url, headers={'User-Agent': 'SI_CLASS'}) 

## Start with this page: https://www.si.umich.edu/directory?field_person_firstname_value=&field_person_lastname_value=&rid=All  
## End with this page: https://www.si.umich.edu/directory?field_person_firstname_value=&field_person_lastname_value=&rid=All&page=11 

def get_umsi_data():
	if "umsi_directory_data" in CACHE_DICTION:
		return CACHE_DICTION["umsi_directory_data"]

	base_url = 'https://www.si.umich.edu/directory?field_person_firstname_value=&field_person_lastname_value=&rid=All&page='
	strings_of_html = []
	for page_number in range(12):
		page_url = base_url + str(page_number)
		html_text = requests.get(page_url, headers = {'User-Agent': 'SI_CLASS'}).text
		strings_of_html.append(html_text)






## PART 2 (b) - Create a dictionary saved in a variable umsi_titles 
## whose keys are UMSI people's names, and whose associated values are those people's titles, e.g. "PhD student" or "Associate Professor of Information"...







## PART 3 (a) - Define a function get_five_tweets
## INPUT: Any string
## Behavior: See instructions. Should search for the input string on twitter and get results. Should check for cached data, use it if possible, and if not, cache the data retrieved.
## RETURN VALUE: A list of strings: A list of just the text of 5 different tweets that result from the search.




## PART 3 (b) - Write one line of code to invoke the get_five_tweets function with the phrase "University of Michigan" and save the result in a variable five_tweets.




## PART 3 (c) - Iterate over the five_tweets list, invoke the find_urls function that you defined in Part 1 on each element of the list, and accumulate a new list of each of the total URLs in all five of those tweets in a variable called tweet_urls_found.
